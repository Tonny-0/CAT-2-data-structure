Memory Allocation: Arrays are static data structures with a fixed size that is known at compile time, which requires contiguous memory allocation. This needs prior knowledge of the number of elements and can lead to ineffective utilization of memory in case the allocated size doesn't represent the actual requirement. Linked lists are dynamic data structures consisting of nodes, where each node contains data and a pointer to the next node. This gives the capability to assign memory as needed at runtime, which fits the case where the number of items is unknown in advance.

Performance: Arrays support constant-time (O(1)) access to elements due to their continuity in memory, enabling direct indexing. Insertion and removal, however, can be expensive since they may encompass moving elements to maintain order. Linked lists, having no direct indexing capability, require linear time (O(n)) to access elements as it has to go through from the head node. But they excel at insertion and deletion, particularly if the modifications are at the beginning or middle of the list, as it's a question of modifying node pointers and not moving elements.

Insertion and Deletion Operations: Insertion and deletion of elements in arrays need shifting of elements that come after it to maintain order, which raises time complexity. Linked lists allow simpler insertion and deletion by adjusting node pointers without the need for element shifting.
